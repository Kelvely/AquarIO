**An open source accessible IO library.**

Support simple network handling and Object-Oriented Storage(OOS) database wrapping.
Provided some simple utilities like scheduler and serialization unification,
which are used in main functions of this library.

Planned to support MySQL in the first version, and Redis, LiteSQL next.
